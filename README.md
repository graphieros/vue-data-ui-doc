## Contributions to the documentation website

Contributions are welcome:)

The documentation website was built in a hurry, so it might appear messy. We are gradually refactoring it so it becomes more pleasing to maintain.

### Translations

Translations are setup on a Pinia store (useMainStore), and serve translations for the following languages:

<ul>
<li>Chinese (simplified)</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>French</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Portuguese</li>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Arabic</li>
</ul>

The quality of translations is probably dubious, as most of them were generated with Google translate.

### Features

The main features of the documentation website are the following:

<ul>
<li>Full docs page for each component</li>
<li>Quick components overview</li>
<li>Search engine for config attributes</li>
<li>Example charts</li>
<li>Customization tips</li>
<li>Chart builder</li>
<li>Package stats</li>
</ul>
